# Choose Your Own Adventure: Refugee Journey

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for "Choose Your Own Adventure: Refugee Journey." This C++ console application offers a narrative-driven experience, placing you in the shoes of a war refugee from Mykolaiv, Ukraine. The game aims to provide insights into the difficult choices and challenges faced by refugees.

## Project Overview
The program unfolds as a series of choices, each leading to different outcomes, some hopeful and others tragic. As the protagonist, you navigate through critical decisions after evacuating from Mykolaiv, Ukraine, post-battle. Your journey takes you across various locations, from Moldova to potentially the United States, each choice branching into different paths and outcomes.

### Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard I/O library

## Features
- Interactive story with multiple decision points.
- Realistic scenarios reflecting the refugee experience.
- Branching narrative structure leading to various endings.
- User input validation
- Usage of C++ loops and conditionals concepts

## Installation and Setup
This project does not require any special installation procedures. To run the game:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).
2. Compile the source file using your C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable to start the game.

## Usage
- Run the program from the command line or an integrated development environment (IDE).
- Follow the on-screen prompts to make choices.
- Each choice you make will lead you down a different path in the narrative.

## Contributing
This project was developed as a personal endeavor to reflect on my own family's wartime refugee crisis. While I am not actively seeking contributions, constructive feedback and suggestions are always welcome.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by real-world events and stories of refugees.
- Thank you to Codecademy that provided this open ended project that allowed me to refine my C++ skills but also express myself creatively.
